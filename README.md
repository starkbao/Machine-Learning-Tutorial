# Machine-Learning-Tutorial

In this repository, you will find several machine learning tutorials. This repository aims to serve as a place for people who want to learn the machine learning models and code them from scratch. Mainly, the tutorials will be written in `.ipynb` or `.py` format. If you have problem on rendering the `.ipynb` file on GitHub, please copy the URL and paste it to [nbviwer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Then, you should be able to view the notebook.
